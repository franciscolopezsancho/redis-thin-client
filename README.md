### Redis Thin Client

This project is just a sample of how simple is to use the library of redis from debashish

It has three samples:
- key/value
- List
- SerDe

First two don't need serialization. The third it does but it's provided through implicits

##### To run just 

`sbt run`

and then pick one of the three choices referred above
